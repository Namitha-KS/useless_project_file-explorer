# Oru Variety File Explorer üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Namitha [9N9ZYICO]

### Project Description
This project is an **Electron.js-based file explorer** with an interactive, mind map-style visualization. It enables users to view and navigate their file system through a visual tree structure represented with **SVG elements**. Key features include:

- **Dynamic File Tree Display**: Visualizes folders and files as interconnected nodes for easy navigation.
- **Theme Customization**: Users can select themes that change the visual appearance of the explorer.
- **Interactive Pan and Zoom**: Supports panning and pinch-to-zoom for seamless exploration.
- **User Personalization**: Personalized headers with user names for an engaging user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures adaptability across different window sizes and devices.

This tool combines the power of **Electron.js** for cross-platform desktop applications and **SVG** for rich, interactive graphics.
